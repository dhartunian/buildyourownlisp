* 4 Steps for Adding Language Features
  1. Syntax
     - Parser modifications
  2. Representation
     - Objects and data to represent feature
  3. Parsing
     - Modify reader/printer
     - AST -> read feature
  4. Semantics
     - Evaluation and manipulation
* Common Pitfalls
  - When writing a builtin operation remember to operate on the ARGUMENTS of the lval that's passed in. This usually involves popping them off the lval first.
  - Remember to delete the container lval that runs the builtin function before returning the newly created lval that's inside to replace it.
* TODOs
  - What is the logic behind who destroys variables and frees their memory? Still don't fully grasp this.
  - Possibly make a version of this in Rust/Go to learn those langs!
  - possibly expand standard lib to include stuff from other lisps
  - how could we make an object model in here?
